> Add general notes about the map here. Example:
> - Gold brick blocks show the most direct path in any given area
> - Whenever you see a red flag that means you are near a quest giver
> - Green pluses are visible on locations with healing kits in them (56,80,200), (333,70 80), (676,70,400), (176,80,230), (-176,70,-600)
> - The player starts with a GPS item that when used will have an arrow appear pointing to the next player objective of their current quest
