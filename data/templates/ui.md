> Describe UI changes here. Example:
> - The hunger meter is removed as the player doesn’t need to eat and cannot starve in this experience
> - Each time the player picks up a necessary quest item a symbol for that item is shown in the top right of the screen
> - When the panther falls asleep there are “Z” particles that can be seen appearing above the mob
