# About the documentation
The best place to start is the [tutorial](/docs/tutorial.md). The tutorial page should be sufficient to get you started with the basics of the library. The tutorial page has links to the other pages in the documentation.

## Older versions of the documentation
If you're looking for an older version of the documentation, just open it on GitHub using the different version tags. The links in the documentation are set up so that you can use them without being redirected to the current state of the repository.
