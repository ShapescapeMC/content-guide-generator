# Writing the Documentation
All documentation files are stored in this repository, in the docs directory. We chose this solution over the wiki because it is easier to maintain and you can easily read it for any version of the program.

The list of pages at the top is automatically generated by the [generate_doctree.py](/generate_doctree.py) script. If you add or remove a page, please run the script to update the list. The first title of the page will be used as the name in the doctree.

All links in the documents should use the path relative to the root of this project. For example, a link to this file is:
```md
[About the documentation](/docs/README.md)
```
This will allow us to have working links in the documentation even for the old versions of the application.
